# Typescript Library Template

A **transparent**, **customizable**, and **equipped** TypeScript library template.
- _Transparent:_ Everything in this template including dependencies, configuration, and intended use is clearly documented here.
- _Customizable:_ This template should be friendly to feature exclusions or additions.
- _Equipped:_ All necessary tooling to bring an idea to fruition is ready out of the box.

Here is a summary of this template's features:
- TypeScript builds with Rollup bundles
- Unit testing with code coverage
- Prettier and linting
- Conventional commits and linting
- Two environment branch and release pipeline
- GitHub CI/CD workflows with automated releases
